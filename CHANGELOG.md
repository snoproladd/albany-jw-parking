# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

---

## [2.5.1] — 2026-05-06
### Added
- RSVP history accordion panel on My Account — shows current-year invitations
  with convention day, shift, last date sent, RSVP response, and responded-on date.
  Panel is hidden when no invitations exist. All formatting done server-side.

### Changed
- `package.json` description updated to reflect actual app purpose.

### Removed
- `kickbox`, `jq`, `build`, `docker`, `netstat`, `bind` npm packages — all were
  unused ghost dependencies responsible for the majority of audit vulnerabilities.
- `types/kickbox.d.ts` — no longer needed.

### Fixed
- `npm audit` reduced from 33 vulnerabilities to 2 low-severity (residual `csurf`
  dependency, no fix available without a major refactor).

> and additional feature work. Jake bumped from 2.4.1.

---

## [2.4.1] — 2026-04
### Fixed
- Invitation Tracker 500 error — `canManageCampaigns` missing from route render
  object and incorrect casing in `invitationTracker.ejs`.
- Decently export incorrect filter — removed erroneous `AND accountType = 'registered'`
  from `getDecentlyExportRows()` in `dbSync.js`.

---

### Added
- **Messaging campaigns** — parent-child batch linking via `parent_batch_id`,
  `response_needed` flag, Follow-up mode in Messaging Center.

  using `createRequire`; displayed in footer.

### Fixed
- Draft promotion bug — `promoteIfComplete()` now called after finalize saves.

  `type="application/json"` data block.

  keep-alive ping every 3 minutes (self-cancels on pool supersession or failure).
